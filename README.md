SpaceBarOS
==========

A spacebar oriented lightweight operating system for the x86 platform.

See [http://irl.unixcab.org/projects/sbos/][] for more details. They may
be merged in here sometime soon.

Experimental Linux Support
--------------------------

Under the linux/ folder, there are some files that allow for the spacebar
application to be compiled under Linux. They do not currently work well at
all and should be avoided. The aim is to make an ncurses wrapper for the
SBOS terminal functions.
